# Component Directory


This directory contains most of the elements you actually see on the webapp.
Note that there are two kinds of components here.

- The conventional components. These are for the main webpage.

- The input form controls - ifc for short. They are deployed by the renderers. For seperation for concerns, renderers have been seperated into a directory of their own.
